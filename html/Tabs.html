                The cat (Felis catus), also known as the domestic cat or housecat to distinguish it from other 
                felines and felids, is a small carnivorous mammal that is valued by humans for its companionship and its 
                ability to hunt vermin and household pests. It has been associated with humans for at least 9,500 years
                and is currently the most popular pet in the world.

                The dog is a domesticated form of the Gray Wolf, a member of the Canidae family of the order Carnivora. 
                The term is used for both feral and pet varieties. The domestic dog has been one of the most widely kept 
                working and companion animals in human history.

                Hamsters are crepuscular. In the wild, they burrow underground in the daylight to avoid being caught by 
                predators. Their diet contains a variety of foods, including dried food, berries, nuts, fresh fruits and 
                vegetables. In the wild they will eat any wheat, nuts and small bits of fruit and vegetables that they might 
                find lying around on the ground, and will occasionally eat small insects such as small fruitflies or mealworms. 
                They have elongated fur-lined pouches on both sides of their heads that extend to their shoulders, which they 
                stuff full of food to be stored, brought back to the colony or to be eaten later.

                An Alligator is a crocodilian in the genus Alligator of the family Alligatoridae. The name alligator is an 
                anglicized form of the Spanish el lagarto (the lizard), the name by which early Spanish explorers and settlers 
                in Florida called the alligator. There are two living alligator species: the American alligator (Alligator 
                mississippiensis) and the Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis).
