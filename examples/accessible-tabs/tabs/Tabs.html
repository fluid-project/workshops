            <h3>Prolegomena</h3>

            <h4>What is logic?</h4>
            <p>Logic is the study of the consistency of beliefs. For beliefs to be consistent it must be possible for them to obtain  at the same time. For example, it is illogical to believe that the sky is completely blue and that the sky is completely red because the sky being entirely blue is inconsistent with its being entirely red, i.e. it is not possible for the sky to be entirely red at the same time as its being entirely blue.</p>
            <p>Logic is also a study of "logical consequence", i.e. what follows by necessity from something else. By studying inconsistency of beliefs, philosophers are able to study the validity of arguments, as will be shown later. Methods of finding whether certain arguments are valid is described later.</p>
            <p>The symbolisation of these sentences, known as formalisation, simplifies and quickens this process. It also enables the philosopher to clarify ideas using an unambiguous language in which to represent thoughts. The sophistication of the language used enables greater insights into the significance of these thoughts (and a cursory analysis of more logical languages is described in Other Logics.</p>
            <h4>Aims of this book</h4>
            <p>This book aims to give the reader a basic understanding of logic and its relationship with philosophy, rather than a more mathematical approach to advanced logic. It is designed to provide the reader with a grasp of terms such as "valid", "consistency", "entailment", which often arise in philosophy, to help the reader comprehend the philosophical issues that use them. Philosophical debates of certain issues are not developed here, and are at most briefly mentioned. Certain assumptions are made; the reader is advised to consider them.</p>

            <h3>Consistency and Inconsistency</h3>
            <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Philosophical_Logic/Consistency_and_Inconsistency">Original chapter from Wikibooks</a>
            <p>Logic is a study of the consistency of beliefs. A belief is part of a psychological state in which a person thinks, is under impression, believes  that the universe has some property. They are readily represented by sentences, a linguistic interpretation. Such sentences can then be evaluated for truth.</p>
            <h4>Truth</h4>
            <p>What is truth? What sort of thing could be considered true?</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Shut that door!</li>
            <li>Are you going to the party?</li>
            <li>Would that I were not hungry.</li>
            <li>A panda eats shoots and leaves.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Of the above sentences, only one, it seems, is capable of being assigned a truth value (considered true or false). The last sentence is true, but what of the others? The first is a command. It can be obeyed or disobeyed, but cannot be true (or false). The second is a question and again cannot be true or false. The third expresses a wish; it may be true that the person uttering it wishes he or she were not hungry, but it itself cannot be evaluated for truth. It shall be said that only <i>declarative</i> statements are evaluable for truth.</p>
            <p>A test, perhaps, for determining if a sentence is declarative or not is to ask if the following question is a meaningful, grammatical question in English:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Is it true that P?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>where P is the sentence being analysed.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Is it true that shut that door?</li>
            <li>Is it true that are you going to the party?</li>
            <li>Is it true that would that I were hungry?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>None of the above is meaningful English. These therefore fail the test.</p>
            <p>So what is it for a declarative sentence to be true. There are many truth theories, each defining truth slightly differently. The definition of truth adopted in this book comes from the <i>correspondence</i> theory, which states that <b>a sentence P is true if and only the state of affairs designated by P obtains</b>; "it is true that P" is true if P. Falsehood is similarly defined for a sentence: <b>a sentence is false if the state of affairs it designates do not exist</b>. Although this seems straightforward and platitudinous, there are complications, explanation of which roams outside the scope of this book. The reader is urged to investigate these!</p>
            <p>For the sake of simplicity it will be assumed that all declarative sentences are true or false and so, <b>if a sentence is true, its negation is false</b>. The <i>negation</i> of a sentence P is any sentence that shares its meaning precisely with the sentence</p>
            <p><b>it is not the case that P</b>.</p>
            <h4>Definition of Consistency</h4>
            <p>Logic is concerned with the consistency of sets of sentences (used to represent beliefs) and with consistent outcomes to processing logical formulae containing operands and operatives. A set of sentences is said to be <b>consistent</b> if and only if <b>there is at least one possible situation in which they are all true</b>. So, the following set of sentences is consistent:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Grass is green.</li>
            <li>It is not the case that the moon is green.</li>
            <li>Most humans have ten fingers.</li>
            <li>Grasshoppers have six legs and dogs have four.</li>
            <li>Earth is a cube.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Note that not all of the sentences are true (sentence 5). However, if the Earth were a cube, it need not be that any of the other sentences are false. There is a <i>possible situation</i> in which they are all true. In this way, logicians are not interested as such in the actual <b>truth value</b> of a sentence (whether it is in fact true or false), but more in a sentence's possible truth values.</p>
            <p>Consider the following English sentences:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>The moon is constituted from cheese.</li>
            <li>The moon is not constituted from cheese.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There is no possible situation in which 1 and 2 are both true, that is to say, it is impossible for them both to be true at the same moment. Such a pair of sentences are said to be inconsistent. A set of sentences is said to be <b>inconsistent</b> if there is <b>no possible situation in which they are all true</b>.</p>
            <p>A set of sentences may consist of only one sentence. In which case, if there is a possible situation in which that sentence is true, the sentence is said to be consistent. If there is no such situation, the sentence is said to be inconsistent.</p>
            <p>For example, "grass is green" and "snow is blue" are examples of consistent sentences (and the set containing them and only them is consistent). The sentences "grass is green" and "grass is blue" (when taken individually) are consistent sentences, but any set containing them both is inconsistent.</p>
            <p>The sentence "2+2=5" is inconsistent. There is no situation in which it is true.</p>
            <p>If two sentences cannot be both true and cannot be both false, they are said to be <b>contradictory</b>. For example, "Socrates was a philosopher" and "Socrates was not a philosopher" are contradictory statements.</p>
            <p>If two sentences cannot be both true at the same time (form an inconsistent set), they are said to be contrary. For example, "I have exactly 10 fingers" and "I have exactly 9 fingers" are contrary (both statements cannot be true, but both could be false). All contradictory statements are contrary.</p>
